# StudyVue

1) Used CLI - 'vue create vue-crashcourse'

-- Personal Notes --

2) App.vue
    - Template is the output/HTML
    - script is the logic
    - style is the styling for the page

3) To use a component, must be defined within the components object. Then may be passed to the template to be displayed.

 
4) scoped within the tag means this is only for this 
specific components scope
